*Requires the script.js file in order to carry out calculations.  
*Project made using Javascript HTML CSS.  
*The program first validates the input by ensuring a value has been typed in it then validates to ensure that the month is not invalid (greater than 12 or less than 0), the same applies for the dates if incorrect dates are entered it requests the user to correct them. It then takes the value and preprocesses them such as by splitting the year into a century and year value,  and by changing the value of the month. It then calculates a day Number that is corrected to a number representing a day of the week where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Monday.
